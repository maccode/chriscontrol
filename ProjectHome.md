## _Beta 2 Released 12 Jan 2010! Get your copy now!_ ##

_As can be seen from the screenshot below, I originally created in ChrisControl back in 2005.  Since it's release, it's popularity has [grown](http://chall32.blogspot.com/2009/07/chriscontrol-is-not-dead-its-just.html) and [grown](http://www.google.co.uk/#hl=en&q=chriscontrol+vnc+rdp&meta=&aq=f&oq=chriscontrol+vnc+rdp&fp=a60718907b4ba39b) beyond all expectation!  The object of this page is as a repository for new releases and to track any issues with those releases._

## What is ChrisControl? ##

Want to connect to that remote system? Unsure if there is any remote control software loaded on the remote system?

**ChrisControl can help!**

All you need is the remote server IP address or hostname and a valid username and password for the remote system.


ChrisControl works by scanning the remote system to see if either RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol aka Terminal Services) or VNC (Virtual Network Computing) servers are installed and running.

  * If RDP is found then the ChrisControl connects to the remote system via RDP client
  * If VNC is found then the ChrisControl connects to the remote system via VNC client
  * If neither are found then (here is the clever bit!) ChrisControl will prompt the user to remotely install VNC Server onto the remote system. ChrisControl will then install VNC server, start and connect to the remote system via VNC


ChrisControl has two further tickbox options:
  * The option of uninstalling VNC server when finished
  * The option of connecting to the console session of the remote system (only supported by Windows XP, Windows 2003 and later)
